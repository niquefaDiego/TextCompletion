For this project we are working with the Spanish data from CoNLL-2002 shared task and can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/teropa/nlp/tree/master/resources/corpora/conll2002">github</a>

For the third column of the data, we found the following information:

O means no named entities
B-XXX first word of the XXX entity
I-XXX all other words of the XXX entity

XXX: PER person
     ORG organization
     LOC locations
     MISC miscellaneous names

Names are suppose to be Non-recursive and non-overlapping
